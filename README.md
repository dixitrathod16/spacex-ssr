SpaceX Launch Programs - Project to demonstrate Server Side Rendering using React and Node.js

This is a sample front end react project which is Server Side Rendered. 

Server Side rendering means rendering your React components on the Server and sending HTML pages pre-populated ro the client - This can lead to a better user experience and Search Engine discoverability.

On the browser, when the javascript runs, react will realize that the component is already there and take over for front-end interactivity, skipping the initial render.

# Technology
- Creation of node server using Express which will render the content for initial request

- Creation of React components using latest React features such as react hooks, react routers etc. 

- Data Fetching on the Server using isomorphic-fetch package

- Data Fetching with Routing (Server-side & Client-side)

- Use of Webpack and Babel Scripts for Build Workflow to create final executable build.

- Use of Media Queries to create fully responsive UI for Mobile, Tablet and Desktop views.
